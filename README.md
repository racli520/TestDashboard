# Realt-time sales dashboard

Dashboard with various widgets to display real-time sales data.

Comes with a controller which allows to 

* manually set the data (via sliders)
* auto-send random data

Note that while the displayed data should all be derived from the sales data, in this demo all data can be adjusted independently. (A database backend which generates connected data sets was part of an earlier version of this demo.)

To start the demo just do 

```shell
crossbar start
```

and open a browser on the same machine to 

```
http://localhost:8080
```
